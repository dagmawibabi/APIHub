# ✨ API Hub ✨

So I use a lot of free and open API's all the time for random apps, experiments and even production ready apps. And time after time I have to relearn their end-points, parameters, query formats and dig through their documentations and more so I can understand their responses and convert them all into suitable formats and that has been tiring. 😵

So I decided to make APIHub, a parent API to all other APIs. I don't have to relearn end-points, dig through their documentations, convert responses to JSON and go through the hassle anymore. I only have to learn this one API and that's it! 🥳

## Best Features

- Not only does it handle basic requests but it also handles nested requests automatically. So your frontend only has to request once, whole the API handles all nested requests and responds with a complete response
- It extends query parameters. It goes further than the basic API usage provided; it handles calculations, date conversions, response limits, data filters, date ranges and so much more.
- All responses are JSON and It's got a predictable error response and handling.
